                    I made a distributed bitcoin simulation. We created participant nodes that 
                    transacted bitcoins with each other, and miner nodes that mined blocks periodically 
                    and added them to the blockchain. The blockchain contained information for all the 
                    transactions, and each participant had a wallet to keep account of their bitcoin 
                    balance. The miner whose block gets added to the blockchain receives a reward. 
                    We built the application in Elixir which is based on Erlang framework, and used 
                    Phoenix web framework to build the web interface.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    We implemented an MIT paper on chord ring protocol to reach a node in the system 
                    in log n time. All nodes form a part of a ring, and nodes can be added and removed 
                    from the ring. The motive of this project was to reach a node from another node using 
                    chord ring protocol, which would usually take n time. Implemented in elixir.

                <p>
                    I built this application to practice Javascript and Jquery. This is a dice game 
                    played by 2 players. Built using JS, HTML, CSS and JQuery.

                    I worked on a project to implement a database using C++. In this project, we 
                    performed data manipulation and retreival on data in tabular form which. The user
                    can enter a cnf to retrieve data.
